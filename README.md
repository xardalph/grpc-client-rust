## Grpc client in rust

Why ? because I wanted to learn rust, the go implementation is the way to go if you want a production ready

## Features :

- retrieve proto file with reflection api (v1 only for now)
- list all service, method and message available
- make a request with parameter from the command line


Here the things I would like to add in "the futur"

- [ ] allow to use reflection v1 or v1alpha with a simple command line parameter, or check both.
- [ ] cache reflection data in a cache file
- [ ] make automated tests
- [ ] allow json to create a message.
